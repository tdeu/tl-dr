Lesson2
We cleaned up unnecessary files from the default project.
We created a basic navbar component.
We implemented the navbar in App.js.
We added navigation items to the navbar (Home, About Me, Dapps, Writings, KODIT.AI).
We discussed the use of <a> tags for navigation and mentioned that we'll use React Router later.

Lesson3
In this lesson, we focused on implementing routing in our React application 
using React Router. We learned that React Router is a crucial library for creating 
single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple views. It allows us to navigate 
between different components without triggering full page reloads, 
resulting in a smoother user experience.
We installed React Router and set up basic routing in our App.js file. 
We learned how to use the <BrowserRouter>, <Routes>, and <Route> components 
to define our application's route structure. We also replaced the <a> tags in 
our Navbar component with React Router's <Link> components, which prevent page 
reloads when navigating.
Additionally, we created separate files for each page component, 
improving our project's organization and modularity. 
We learned how to import these components and use them in our routing setup. 
This structure allows for easier maintenance and development of individual pages.
